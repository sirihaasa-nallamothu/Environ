<h1> The Problem </h1>
<article>
<p class="content"> Our daily lives have become more on-the-go and dependent on electricity and technology than ever before. But even though the human lifestyle is surging forward, itâ€™s coming at a steep cost - the environment. The more we rely on and use transportation and electricity, the more heat-trapping greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, causing the planet to warm at an alarming pace. This is not even to mention the plastics polluting the ocean, deforestation disrupting ecosystems, and more. Without the proper information or call to action, we may lose the planet which we call home. </p>
<h1> Why Environ? </h1>
<p class = "content"> The problems facing the environment may seem overwhelmingly large, but with the right knowledge and resources, anyone can play a part in stopping climate change right from their own homes! We built Environ to empower people to take small steps for big change. Users can become inspired, make a difference with simple actions share their accomplishments, and inspiring even more activists. By engaging with a social media-based interface, users can share their actions, inspiring others to take a stand as they have. With Environ, environmentalism is contagious! </p>
